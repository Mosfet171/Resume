                        Once upon a time, in a land of algorithms and coffee, a Computer Engineering grad discovered that life is more than just coding.<br><br> 

                        So, he packed his bags and hit the road, exploring the world one passport stamp at a time. By day, he’s a business mogul in Vietnam, opening businesses that mix tech, culture, and a lot of fun. By night, he’s a DJ spinning hard beats. <br><br>

                        He's now back in Europe, ready to code again and tell his stories. <br><br>
